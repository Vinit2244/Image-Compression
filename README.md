# Linear Algebra Course Project: Image Compression Algorithms Comparison

## Overview

Welcome to the repository for our Linear Algebra course project conducted during the second semester. In this project, we explored and compared various image compression algorithms to determine their effectiveness. The team, consisting of Vinit Mehta, Swarang Joshi, and Nijesh Raghava, focused on three main methods: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Discrete Cosine Transform with wavelet transform, and Vector Quantization.

## Project Goals

The primary objectives of this project were as follows:

1. **Algorithm Implementation**: Implement the SVD, DCT with wavelet transform, and vector quantization algorithms for image compression.

2. **Comparison Metrics**: Develop metrics for comparing the performance of each algorithm, such as compression ratio, image quality, and computational efficiency.

3. **Experimental Setup**: Conduct experiments using a variety of images to evaluate and compare the algorithms under different scenarios.

4. **Documentation**: Provide detailed documentation explaining the theoretical foundations of each algorithm, the implementation details, and the results of our experiments.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **/src**: Contains the source code for the implemented algorithms.
  - /svd: SVD algorithm implementation, data and results.
  - /dct_wavelet_transform: DCT with wavelet transform implementation, data and results.
  - /vector_quantization: Vector quantization algorithm implementation, data and results.
- **/docs**: Documentation files, including theoretical explanations and implementation details.
